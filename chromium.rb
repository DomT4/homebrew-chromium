    You can either copy Chromium to Applications:
      cp -rf #{opt_prefix}/Chromium.app /Applications
    Or start using the sha256-verified Cask I've added to this tap:
      brew cask install mac-chromium

    Please note that if you go down that route you will need to periodically
    run:
      brew cask upgrade mac-chromium
  EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_predicate prefix/"Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium", :exist?
  end
end
