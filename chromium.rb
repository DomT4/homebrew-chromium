  def caveats; <<-EOS.undent
    Homebrew has chosen to deprecate the linkapps function, which is a step
    towards killing the usefulness and support of installing .apps through
    Homebrew formulae completely. I strongly disagree with removing app
    functionality through Homebrew formulae but the decision is out of my
    hands, sorry.

    You can work around this once linkapps stops functioning by doing:
      cp -rf #{opt_libexec}/Chromium.app /Applications
    Or start using the sha256-verified Cask I've added to this tap:
      brew cask install mac-chromium

    Please note that Homebrew currently has no automatic upgrade functionality
    for casks, so if you go down that route you will need to periodically run:
      brew cask reinstall mac-chromium
  EOS
  end
end
