      Linkapps has been deprecated by Homebrew.

      You can either move Chromium to Applications manually or
      with the provided installation script:
        #{opt_libexec}/install-chrome
      Or start using the sha256-verified Cask I've added to this tap:
        brew cask install mac-chromium

      Please note that if you go down that route you will need to
      periodically run:
        brew cask upgrade mac-chromium
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_predicate libexec/"install-chrome", :exist?
  end
end
