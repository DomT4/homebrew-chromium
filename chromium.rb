    Linkapps has been deprecated by Homebrew.

    You can either copy Chromium to Applications:
      cp -rf #{opt_libexec}/Chromium.app /Applications
    Or start using the sha256-verified Cask I've added to this tap:
      brew cask install mac-chromium

    Please note that Homebrew currently has no automatic upgrade functionality
    for casks, so if you go down that route you will need to periodically run:
      brew cask reinstall mac-chromium
  EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_predicate libexec/"Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium", :exist?
  end
end
