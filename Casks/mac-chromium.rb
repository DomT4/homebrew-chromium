    As of https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/commit/7af98a34ae
    Homebrew Cask has moved to a checksummed and versioned Chromium cask.

    If you wish to migrate you can:
      brew cask uninstall mac-chromium && brew cask install chromium

    This tap will remain supported for the foreseeable.
