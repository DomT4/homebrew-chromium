Chromium Snapshots Delivered Through Homebrew!

------

How do I tap this repository?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap domt4/chromium`.

It really is that simple. Yay! Fresh Chromium delivered regularly. Like bread, but less edible.

--------------------------------

Yes, the [Caskroom/Brew-Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) does this sort of thing too.

However, when I created this repository they distributed the Portable, Flash-enabled version of Chromium and I didn’t want or need that. In early November 2014 the Caskroom switched to using the direct downloads from the Appspot blog, but due to the nature of these downloads the Caskroom also disabled checksumming of that file for integrity, which isn't a risk I love.

The Caskroom’s formula also makes it extremely difficult for people to remain on up-to-date Chromium versions, as Chromium ships with no built-in update method.

This tap will never be used for anything other than Chromium. 

For fun: When I started this repository on October the 8th 2014 Chromium was on Commit Number 298608. Compare that to where we are today (!).
